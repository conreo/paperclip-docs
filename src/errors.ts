/**
 * Sanitising server errors before they reach a board member's screen.

 * Paperclip passes database errors through verbatim. The reference CodeGraph
 * plugin rendered this on its settings page after a failed Activate:
 *
 *   Failed query: insert into "tool_mcp_gateways" ("id", "company_id", …)
 *   values (default, $1, default, …)
 *   params: 11111111-…,CodeGraph,codegraph,…,,usr_0000000000000000000000000000,…
 *
 * That is a full SQL statement **and its bound parameters** — which can include
 * secrets — displayed in a governance UI. Two separate problems: it leaks, and it
 * is useless to the person reading it. This plugin inherits the fix rather than
 * rediscovering it, because the failure mode is in the host, not in the plugin.
 *
 * Applied at the display boundary only. Conflict classification still sees the raw
 * text, because deciding "already exists" from a sanitised message would be
 * deciding it from a message we wrote ourselves.
